        <p style="position: relative; left: 45px; top: 100px;"><i>THE ECSTASY OF COMMUNICATION, jean baudrillard</i>
        </p>
        <p style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 100px;">this piece is very fascinating as it was written in
            1987. yet, it predicts specific behaviors that are prominently seen in today's society. </p>
        <p style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 100px;">the concept of public space no longer being a spectacle,
            and private space no longer being a secret reinforces the idea that modern media consumption has
            desensitized people from real-world stimuli. </p>
